# Email-Collector-Raw-Code
Do not run this code on your local computer. Please run this code on a online ide like repl.it , where ip changes with reload. Because to find email addresses so many pages are crawled. And it works by searching on google. So, google will give you ip block. You can modify this code according to your wish, you can change base query('que= @gmail.com'  in the code), you can use other mail domain like yahoo or hotmail. you can use site also like linked.in. I am just giving you a idea how  the search query works. It works with "google advance search" & you can always manipulate this.
